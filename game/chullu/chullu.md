You dream of stormy waves on a vast gray sea. As you fly over the whitecaps whipped by the
wind, you feel the cold spray one your face. In the distance, the surface is boiled by something
vast rising from the deep.

Your feet touch the stone tile of a small ancient temple rising just above the sea. The waves break
and splash across the temple floor. Inlaid in the floor is a symbol you recognize. The Octal Eye.

You awake.

You splash water on your face. You remember the symbol of the Octal Eye from the tomb in Cairo.

You need some coffee and fresh air.
